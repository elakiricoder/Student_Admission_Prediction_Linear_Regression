# Student_Admission_Prediction_Linear_Regression
This is a simple Linear Regression Model to Predict the Student Admission. 

The language is Python and the Jupyter Notebook is used.

Data set is obtained from Kaggle  - https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions?select=Admission_Predict_Ver1.1.csv

This dataset is clean. The only issue was there is a space at the end of Chance of Admit.

Again, this is for the absolute beginners only.
